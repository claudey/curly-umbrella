### Deployment Strategy
- **Staging:** Heroku or AWS with PostgreSQL
- **Production:** AWS/GCP with managed database
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing/deployment
- **Monitoring:** Sentry for error tracking, New Relic for performance
- **Backups:** Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
